## Machine Learning HW1
## COVID-19 Cases Prediction  

## Objectives  
* Solve a regression problem with deep neural networks(DNN).
* Understand basic DNN training tips
e.g. hyper-parameter tuning, feature selection,regularization,...
* Get familiar with PyTorch.  

## Task Description  
* COVID-19 Cases Prediction
* Source:Delphi group @ CMU
    * A daily survey since April 2020 via facebook.

<font color="red">Do not attempt to find any related data!Using additional data is prohibited and your final grade $\times$ 0.9</font>

* Given survey results in the past 3 days in a specific state in U.S.,then predict the percentage of new tested positive cases in the 3rd day.

    * e.g. AL,AK,AZ,...
* COVID-like illness(4)
    * e.g. cli,ili(influenza-like illness),...
* Behavior Indicators(8)
    * e.g. wearing_mask,travel_outside_state,...
* Mental Health Indicators(5)
    * e.g. anxious,depressed,...

## Data -- One-hot Vector  
* One-hot vectors:
Vectors with only one element equals to one while others are zero.
Usually used to encode discrete values.

## Data -- Training  

covid.train.csv (2700 samples)

## Evaluation Metric  
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
$$
RMSE=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N}(f(X^n)-{\hat{y}}^n)^2}
$$

## Grading -- Bonus  
* If you got 10 points, we make your code public to the whole class.  

* In this case, if you also submit **a PDF report briefly describing your methods**  less than 100 words in English,you get a bonus of 0.5 pt.  
(your report will also be available to all students)

## Code Submission  
* NTU COOL (4pts)  
    * Compress your code and report into `<student ID>_hw1.zip`

    * We can only see your last submission.
    * Do not submit your model or dataset.
    * If your code is not reasonable,your semester grade $\times$ 0.9.
    * You must specify the source of your code.  
    * E.g., add a **Reference** block at the bottom of your code.

## Deadlines
* Kaggle 
2021/03/26 23:59(UTC+8)
* Code Submission (NTU COOL)
2021/03/28 23:59(UTC+8)

## Hints
* Simple Baseline
    * Sample code
* Medium Baseline
    * Feature selection: 40 states + 2 tested_positive
    (will be demonstrated in class)
* Strong Baseline
    * Feature selection (what other features are useful?)
    * DNN architecture (layers?dimension?activation function?)
    * Training (mini-batch?optimizer?learning rate?)
    * L2 regularization
    * There are some mistakes in the sample code, can you find them?

## Regulations Again  
* You should finish your homework on your own.  
* You should not modify your prediction files manually.
* Do not share codes or prediction files with any living creatures.
* Do not use any approaches to submit your results more than 5 times a day.
* Do not search or use additional data or pre-trained models.
* Your final grade x 0.9 if you violate any of the above rules.
* Prof. Lee & TAs preserve the rights to change the rules & grades.  

## If any questions, you can ask us via...
* NTU COOL (recommended)
    * https://cool.ntu.edu.tw/courses/4793
* Email
    * ntu-ml-2021spring-ta@googlegroups.com
    * The title should begin with "[hw1]"
* TA hour
    * Each Friday during class
